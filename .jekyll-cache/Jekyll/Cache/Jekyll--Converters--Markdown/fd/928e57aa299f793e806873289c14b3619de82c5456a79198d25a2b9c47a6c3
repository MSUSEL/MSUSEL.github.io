<p>The software Engineering Laboratory (SEL) is primarily concerned with studies that deal with the empirical understanding of software phenomena. 
Over the years we have built a foundation on research that explores how software design patterns evolve. 
Design patterns can be thought of as micro-architectures with well defined structure and behavior, thus changes observed over the evolution of their lifespans can be measured against higher level abstractions. 
Many problems are embedded in this research: pattern recognition, taxonomies, behavioral and structural measurement, grime phenomena, automated refactoring, static analysis, technical debt, simulation, and different forms of case studies and formal experiments.</p>
