# Tools

This page will provide documentation for tools used or considered for use by the lab. The title of each tool section will be a link to the 
associated website or location of the tool (if available), and references are included for further reading on each tool. 

## [iPlasma](http://loose.upt.ro/iplasma/)

iPlasma is the integrated Platform for software modeling and analysis. 
This tool measures and visualizes design-based code smells using an 'overview pyramid' that considers three structural aspects of a system (size and complexity, coupling, and inheritance). These aspects are measured using several design-focused metrics, and are then ranked against other benchmarked projects. The results from this tool can be used to identify design smells and disharmonies, following Marinescu's (the creator of this tool) method of detection using design strategies.
