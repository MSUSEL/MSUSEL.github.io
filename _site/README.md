# MSUSEL.github.io
Website repo for the Montana State University Software Engineering Labs

### Overview
This repository holds the website code for the MSUSEL website at <https://msusel.github.io/>.

It uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to allow the ability to write webpages in markdown, and [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) as the website theme.

### Website Modifications
The following instructions describe how to made changes to the website starting from scratch:
1) Install Ruby, Jekyll, and Bundler by following the instructions at <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/> (only up to step 2)
2) Clone this repository locally
3) At the project root level, run `bundle install`
4) Serve the project locally with `bundle exec jekyll server`. Navigate to `localhost:4000` and ensure the site looks okay.
5) To modify the site,
  - Create (or modify) a `file_name.md` file at the root level of the `MSUSEL.github.io` local project.
  - At the top of the markdown file, add the following header:
    ```
    ---
    layout: page
    title: My title
    ---
    ```
  - On saving, Jekyll will automatically compile the markdown into HTML and add the new page as a content link on the left hand side of the website.
  - Confirm the changes look correct locally by saving and going to `localhost:4000`
  - Publish the changes to <https://msusel.github.io/> by commiting the changes and pushing to master. The rest is handled automatically but can take a few minutes to reflect all changes.
  - Ensure the changes didn't break the website, revert the commit if so.


### Gotcha's:
- Development on Windows often has a few idiosyncracies when following online guides usually having to do with dependencies. The solutions to these bugs is but a Google search away. 
- The hosted site at <https://msusel.github.io/> can take up to 10 minutes to fully update after a master push.
- GitHub Pages has a few more restrictions and oddities than you will experience in normal web development. What appears on <msusel.github.io> may be different than what happens on localhost.
- The autogenerated `_site` folder needs to not be in the .gitignore.
Due to Jekyll essentially acting as a Ruby to HTML compiler, GitHub pages is reading the html, css, and js in the `_site` folder to host the site, thus it must exist in the repository.
There are likely fixes to this.



### TODO
- Put markdown pages in their own *pages* folder. Will likely need to use Jekyll collections.
- Have markdown docs files autogenerate a table on contents on the right hand side of page.
- Address all todos marked in the project.
