I am a PhD student in Computer Science at MSU-Bozeman. 
I am from Golden, Colorado, a mountain town centered around a small college. 
I held an internship in Golden this past summer with CoorsTek, the world's largest ceramics manufacturing company. 
While there, I programmed with software to make it easier for others to record dimensional analysis tests of ceramic parts. 
My interests in computing lie primarily in networking and system administration. I enjoy learning of the challenges that new networking algorithms must face. 
Also, and in part due to my internship, I am proficient at software testing; making sure that a user will not be confused or have difficulties with a process.
