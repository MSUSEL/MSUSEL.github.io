## Current Projects
### Decay, Grime and Technical Debt - Isaac Griffith and Derek Reimanis
###### Analysis of the Structural and Behavioral Characteristics of Design Patterns
We are working towards a more complete understanding of the structural properties and vulnerabilities associated with design patterns.
These vulnerabilities are manifested as design pattern grime and design pattern rot.
Through a more complete understanding we intend to identify methods by which we can assign a technical debt value to the identified vulnerabilities in a design pattern instantiation.
Along with technical debt measurement associated with design pattern issues we are also interested in the use of refactoring as a means to reduce or remove these debts, the development of simulation techniques to artificially insert grime and rot into pattern instances, and the development of a taxonomy that addresses the types of debts associated with design patterns.
 Along this path we will be developing several tools which will help automate the data collection process as well as form a base set of empirical software engineering tools for researchers.
