# Undergraduate Students

## Blake Stanger
![Blake Stanger](/assets/img/blake.jpg){:style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"  height="28%" width="28%"}
Blake Stanger is an undergraduate student of computer science, Montana State University. Blake is consumed by a sense of discovery and exploration.  He has traveled extensively in several countries including India, China, Cambodia, Thailand, Iceland, Sweden, and Vietnam. Interesting economic times have led Blake to try his hand at many fields.

He graduated with honors in 2013 with an English Teaching degree from Montana State University. Blake led a small classroom in Anaconda, Montana. He taught all levels, remedial reading all the way to advanced placement English for his small community. Blake has also led a team of diesel mechanics at the family business to repair and rebuild one of his favorite marvels of endurance: the diesel engine. Next Blake built farming irrigation systems. He is particularly proud of an entirely gravity fed thirty thousand gallon system built from scratch that operates in northern California on 500 acres. One influence was strong in all these fields. Computer science has been and will be a massive influence in our society. Once Blake understood the profound power technology will have in the coming years he returned to study at MSU in 2018.

Blake loves to understand complex systems, and explain those systems to others. Blake values efficiency.  He hopes to fuse his knowledge of education, machines, and technology to positively contribute to society. Blake is grateful to those who have taken the time to teach him and looks forward to helping others with their education.

In his spare time Blake loves to write and is thirty thousand words into creating a novel, a story about adventure and coming of age in the modern American West. He also loves mountain biking, nature, and hunting.
